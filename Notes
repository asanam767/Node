üí° Key Difference:
Cookies = Stored on your browser (remembers info even after closing the site).
Sessions = Stored on the server (temporary and ends when you log out or close the browser).
‚è≥ Can Sessions Be Stored in Cookies?
Yes! Websites can store session IDs inside cookies to track users across visits. This is called a session cookie.

üîë Authentication vs. Authorization
1Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication (Who are you?)

It's the first step where you prove who you are.
Example: Logging in with your username & password.
Think of it like showing your ID card to enter a building.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Authorization (What can you access?)

After authentication, the system checks what you're allowed to do.
Example: Even after logging in, a normal user can't access admin features.
Think of it like having a VIP pass that lets you enter only certain rooms.
üî• Key Difference:
Authentication = Are you the right person? (Login step ‚úÖ)
Authorization = What are you allowed to do? (Permissions check ‚úÖ)

Tokens:
üî• Why Are Tokens Better Than Cookies for Authentication?
‚úÖ Tokens (like JWT - JSON Web Tokens) are self-contained

Once issued, they contain all the needed information.
No need to check the database every time.
They are verified using a secret key (for HMAC) or a public-private key pair (for RSA).
‚úÖ Cookies require database lookups

Traditional session-based authentication stores session IDs in cookies.
Each time a user makes a request, the server must fetch session data from the database.
This creates extra load on the server.
‚úÖ Tokens are stateless

The server doesn‚Äôt store any session data.
The user sends the token with each request, and the server just verifies it using the secret key.
This makes it faster and scalable.
‚úÖ Tokens work across different servers (better for microservices)

Since they don‚Äôt depend on server storage, you can use them across multiple servers or APIs without issues.
Useful for mobile apps, third-party integrations, and Single Sign-On (SSO).
But Cookies Still Have Some Advantages
More secure by default (especially when using HTTP-Only, Secure, and SameSite flags).
Easier to implement for simple applications.
Better protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because they are tied to the domain.
When to Use What?
üîπ Use Tokens (JWT) if you need:
‚úÖ Scalable, stateless authentication.
‚úÖ Multi-server or microservices setup.
‚úÖ Mobile apps or APIs needing authentication.

üîπ Use Cookies (Session-based) if you:
‚úÖ Want better security with HTTP-only and Secure flags.
‚úÖ Are working on a traditional web app with fewer authentication needs.
‚úÖ Need automatic session management (handled by browsers).

üöÄ Conclusion: Tokens (JWT) are generally better for modern web apps and APIs because they remove database dependency. But cookies still work well for traditional session-based authentication.

1. **User Sends Request with Token**
When the user logs in, they receive a token (usually a JWT).
Every time the user makes subsequent requests to the server (for protected routes or resources), they send this token as part of the Authorization header in their request:
makefile
Copy
Edit
Authorization: Bearer <token>
2. Server Extracts and Verifies the Token

The server, through middleware (like the jwtAuthMiddleware you shared), extracts the token from the Authorization header.
The server then checks if the token exists. If it doesn‚Äôt, the server sends a 401 Unauthorized response, indicating that authentication is required.
If the token exists, the server verifies it. Typically, the server uses a secret key to verify that the token was actually issued by the server and has not been tampered with.
If the token is valid (i.e., it hasn‚Äôt expired, and it matches the server‚Äôs secret key), the server can trust the user is authenticated.
If the token is invalid (expired, tampered, or incorrect), the server sends a 403 Forbidden response.
3. Proceed with the Request

If the token is valid, the server proceeds to handle the request (e.g., retrieving data, processing an action) and sends a response back to the client.
If the token is invalid or missing, the request is denied, and the client cannot proceed.
Summary:
User -> Sends token -> Server (JWT middleware) -> Verifies token -> If valid, proceed with request; if not, return error.

Why does jwt.verify() return the decoded payload?
When a server issues a JWT (JSON Web Token), it typically includes some important information inside the token's payload, such as:

User's ID (e.g., userId)
User's role (e.g., role)
Permissions or any other useful data
Expiration time (exp), to manage the token‚Äôs validity
When the server verifies the token using jwt.verify(), it's not just checking if the token is valid (signed with the correct secret) or expired, but it also decodes the payload of the token and makes that information available to the server.

Why does the server "return" the decoded payload?
The reason for returning the decoded payload after verification is:

Authentication Confirmation:

The server can confirm that the request is from the user who the token represents.
By extracting the payload, the server gets information like the user's ID or role to identify who is making the request.
Access to User Information:

The server doesn‚Äôt have to look up the database for this information again (since it is already encoded in the token).
For example, if the payload includes userId, the server can easily access it to perform user-specific actions (e.g., fetch the user‚Äôs data, check if they have permissions).
Here‚Äôs how the flow works in a typical case:

User Logs In:

The server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client (typically as an HTTP-only cookie or in the response body).
This token contains encoded information about the user (e.g., userId, role, permissions).
User Sends Request:

When the user makes a request to a protected route (like accessing their profile or making a purchase), the client sends this token in the Authorization header:
text
Copy
Edit
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Server Verifies Token:

The server extracts the token from the request and verifies it with the jwt.verify() method.
If the token is valid (i.e., not expired or tampered with), the server decodes the payload and gets the user‚Äôs info (e.g., userId, role).
Use Decoded Payload:

After verifying and decoding the token, the server can use this decoded data to:
Identify the user (userId)
Check their role (role) and apply permissions
Access other details stored in the token (e.g., access control)
Proceed with the Request:

The server can now perform the action on behalf of the user (e.g., get user-specific data, perform CRUD operations, etc.).
The server can also include the data from the payload in the response if needed (e.g., sending back the user's profile information).
Why do we need to verify and decode the token every time?

Security:

Each request must prove that it is coming from an authenticated user, and the server has to verify the token's integrity every time.
The server doesn't store session data, so it relies on the token to authenticate and authorize the user on each request.
Stateless Authentication:

JWT allows stateless authentication, meaning the server doesn‚Äôt need to store session data. Instead, it relies on the token, which carries all the information needed.
This makes it easier to scale applications because there‚Äôs no need for the server to store session information for each user.
User Identification:

By decoding the token, the server knows who is making the request. For example, if the payload contains userId, the server can use that to retrieve user-specific data (e.g., from a database).
