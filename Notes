🔑 Authentication vs. Authorization
1️⃣ Authentication (Who are you?)

It's the first step where you prove who you are.
Example: Logging in with your username & password.
Think of it like showing your ID card to enter a building.
2️⃣ Authorization (What can you access?)

After authentication, the system checks what you're allowed to do.
Example: Even after logging in, a normal user can't access admin features.
Think of it like having a VIP pass that lets you enter only certain rooms.
🔥 Key Difference:
Authentication = Are you the right person? (Login step ✅)
Authorization = What are you allowed to do? (Permissions check ✅)
